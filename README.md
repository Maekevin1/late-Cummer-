> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that A Probot app and [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/) which will send updates about your GitHub repo in WhatsApp. 

> So, I was working on our undergrad project on GitHub and our team has a WhatsApp group where we discuss everything about our project that's where I thought why can't we have something that gives us every update on our project GitHub repo by notifying us in our WhatsApp group.
