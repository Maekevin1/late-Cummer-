> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that A Probot app and [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/) which will send update about your Github repo in whatsapp. <br>So, I was working on our undergrad project on GitHub and our team have a whatsapp group where we discuss everything about our project and thats where I though why can't we have something that give us every updates of our project GitHub repo by notifying us in our whatsapp qroup.
